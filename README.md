# Shopping List Application
This project is about a simple shopping list  application that helps users keep track of items they
want to purchase at a store or market.

The application uses a Real-time Database.
While doing this project I learnt how to integrate a real-time Firebase database in the
application.

I also learnt about the webmanifest file that helps in making the application feel like a
Progressive Web App by defining the app's appearance and behavior.
